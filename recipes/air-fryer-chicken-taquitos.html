    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green chiles (such as Ortega®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican-style hot tomato sauce (such as El Pato®)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Neufchâtel cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add green chiles and Mexican tomato sauce; stir to combine. Add shredded chicken, Mexican cheese blend, and Neufchâtel cheese. Cook and stir until cheeses have melted and mixture is warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 3 tablespoons of chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold over and roll into taquitos.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place taquitos in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil. Cook until golden brown, 6 to 9 minutes. Turn taquitos over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
